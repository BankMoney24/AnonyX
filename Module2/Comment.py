# COMMENTS IN PYTHON
# Comments in Python are non-executable statements. It means neither the Python compiler nor the PVM (Python Virtual Machine) will execute them.
# Comments are intended for human understanding, not for the compiler or PVM. Therefore they are called non-executable statements.
# Two types of commenting features are available in Python: single-line and multi-line comments.

# SINGLE LINE COMMENT
# A single-line comment begins with a hash (#) symbol and helps mention that the whole line should be considered a comment until the end.

# Example:

#Defining a variable to store number.
# n = 50 #Store 50 as value into variable n.

# 1)The first line starts with the hash symbol in the above example program, so the entire line is considered a comment.
# 2)The second line of code, N = 50, is a statement, and after the statement, the comment begins with the # symbol.
# The line will be treated as a comment from the # symbol to the end of this line.

# MULTIPLE-LINE-COMMENTS
# A multi-line comment is helpful when we need to comment on many lines.
# You can also use a single-line comment, but using a multi-line instead of a single-line comment is easy to comment on multiple lines.
# In Python, Triple double quotes (""") and single quotes (''') are used for Multi-line commenting.
# It is used at the beginning and end of the block to comment on the entire block. Hence it is also called block comments.

# line one

# Example:

# # DOCSTRINGS
# # Triple double coat (""") and single coat (''') are actually docstrings, which are also used as comments.
# # The key usage of docstrings is explained in the Python API Documentation, and you'll learn more about it in further tutorials.
# a = 10; # a is a variable
# c = 15; # c is a variable

# b = a + c; # additional operation
# print(b); # show the result
