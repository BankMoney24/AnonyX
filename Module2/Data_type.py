PYTHON DATA TYPES 
Python data types are simple to understand and easy to use. They differ in some aspects from other programming languages.
Because Python is an interpreted programming language and the Python interpreter can determine what type of data is being stored, there is no need to define the data type of memory location.

Data type plays a vital role in Python as it determines several aspects:

1) Possible values: Each data type can hold a specific range of values. For example, integers represent whole numbers, while floats represent decimal numbers.
2)Permissible operations: Different data types support specific operations. For example, numeric types support arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
and multiplication, while string data types only support string concatenation.
3)Meaning of data: Data types convey the meaning and purpose of the data.
For instance, a string data type variable typically stores textual data, whereas a boolean variable only stores true or false values.
4)Storage of values: How values are stored in memory differs for each data type. Integers, for instance, are typically stored as fixed-size binary representations, whereas strings are usually stored as character sequences.

Data types available in Python 
Everything in Python programming is an object, each with its unique identity (a type and a value).
There are many native(built-in) data types available in Python. Some important are:

NUMERIC TYPES 

Data-Types  	Description 	                   Example
int	          Signed Integer	                   x = 10
float	    Floating-Point Number	               y = 3.14
complex	      Complex Number	                   z = 2 + 3j

SEQUENCE TYPES

Data-Types     Description	     Example
str	            String	      name = "John"
bytes	        Bytes	       b = b"Hello"
list	        List	      numbers = [1, 2, 3]
tuple	        Tuple	      coordinates = (10, 20)
range	        Range	        r = range(5)

MAPPING TYPE  

Data-Types	  Description	Example
dict	       Dictionary	person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}

SET TYPES  

Data-Types   	  Description	  Example
set	                Set	          s = {1, 2, 3}
frozenset	        Frozen Set	  fs = frozenset([4, 5, 6])

BOOLEAN TYPE  

Data-Types	    Description	  Example
bool	          Boolean	  is_true = True


OTHER TYPES 

Because Python is a pure object-oriented programming language, other data types are also available.

Data-Types	      Description	      Example
module	           Module	        import math
function	       Function	    def add(x, y): return x + y
class	            Class	      class Car:
method	           Method	    class Car: def accelerate(self, speed):
file	             File	    f = open("data.txt", "r")


The above table classifies the important built-in data types in Python based on their functionality and purpose, making it easier to understand their respective categories.
